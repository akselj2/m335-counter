### m335 counter prototype 1
simple recreation of the first module

does everything as needed:
counter saves even if user closes it
UI state doesn't change whenever orientation or screensize changes

includes an espresso test counting up to 6, reducing it to 2 and resetting it. afterwards it checks whether the count is at 0 or not.
